            Hi! I'm Hunter, the sole  designer and creator of the Zany Lights show.
            Everything you see in the show has been custom-constructed and programmed,
            taking months of prep to get a show running every year.<br><br>
            This Behind the Scenes look will take you on a tour of how I started,
            and show you how a display like this is created!
        </p>

                <p class="middle" id="p1">
                    In 2017, when I was 15 years old, I saw a video of a Christmas light show online and thought I HAD to do that too.
                    So, I hacked together a board that could control 16 channels of regular, AC Christmas lights
                    and created a very simple show on my parents' house. This was only meant to be a test for my
                    eyes only, but as I mentioned my project to my friends they were all amazed by the display!
                </p>

                <p class="middle" id="p2">
                    Because of the unexpected success in my first "test" year, I decided to dive in and purchase
                    color-changing LED pixels, just like the ones seen lighting the display today. This changed
                    the game in how I programmed my shows and opened up the doors to many posibilities. Like the
                    previous year, I started simple, but this time made it a bit more public. Neighbors, friends,
                    and family loved the unique and fun show as this was the first one of its kind in my town.
                </p>

                <p class="middle" id="p3">
                    I kept the show going without many changes until 2021, when I decided to do a complete overhaul
                    and add more rooflines, candy canes, singing trees, and a wreath. These new props are what tied
                    the show together and allowed me to further engage with viewers through singing, jokes, puns, and,
                    of course, fun songs. After going viral on the social media platform Nextdoor, I was approached
                    by a WTOP reporter who wrote a story that was distributed all around the country. Soon, cars filled
                    with eager families packed out the neighborhood, patiently waiting their turn to see the show.

                <p class="middle" id="p4">
                    Unfortunately, due to the nightly high traffic volumes created by the show, hosting the show at my
                    parents' house was not feasible anymore, so I started looking for a new venue. Thankfully,
                    Cornerstone Church reached out and requested a show installed on their building, which brings us
                    here where we are today. This show has over five times the amount of lights as previously, and is
                    by far the most intense project I have ever completed.<br><br>
                    I am so excited for the future of this project and am looking forward to many future years of
                    bringing joy to families from all over the country.

        <h2>The Tech</h2>
        <p>
            For those who are interested in the technical side of things, you've come to the right place.
        </p><br>
        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>
            The show all starts in a program called <a href="http://xlights.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xLights</a>.
            This program has all the tools needed to lay out the show, assign controllers to lights, and sequence effects to music.
            The majority of my time is spent in this free program.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Control System</h4>
        <p>
            Once the show has been programmed, it is uploaded to what is really the beating heart of the entire show: a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi</a>.
            This tiny, $35 computer is the brains behind the entire show and is responsible for running the whole thing. Running a software called <a href="https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp#:~:text=The%20Falcon%20Player%20(FPP)%20is,FPP%20supports%20many%20more%20systems." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Falcon Player (FPP)</a>,
            this device allows a show to be scheduled on a calendar to automatically run.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Raspberry Pi computer sends out lighting data (DMX) to the main pixel controller, a <a href="https://pixelcontroller.com/store/products/71-f48v4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Falcon F48V4</a>.
            This device translates the lighting data from the Raspbery Pi into data the pixels can understand. Finally, the last stop is at one of 25 <a href="https://pixelcontroller.com/store/expansion-boards-and-receivers/72-4-string-differential-receiver-v200-board.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Falcon SmartReceivers</a> scattered throughout the display.
            Each smart receiver has four ports to which props can be directly plugged in.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Lights</h4>
        <p>
            Every light used in this display is an intelligent WS2811 pixel. These are individually-controlled LED lights that can display over 16 million colors.
            There are about 10,000 of these pixels in the display. By combining these pixels in certain patterns, like snowflakes, singing bulbs, etc., all sorts of effects can be created.
